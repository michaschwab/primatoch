# Primatoch
## Product recommendation website _(Under Construction)_

This project is temporarily hosted at www.vanhaalen.github.io/primatoch and will be migrated to www.primatoch.nl when completed.

### Setup

Primatoch is designed as a static website. Product pages are generated with a Gulp task from an HTML template
and a data object at build, and interactive elements like search suggestions rely on client-side JavaScript. 

I am mostly following [BEM](http://getbem.com/) naming conventions and the [Airbnb JavaScript styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), and I am striving to write highly-organized and readable code.

**Tools used:**
* Gulp
* Webpack
* NodeJS
* PostCSS
* Babel
